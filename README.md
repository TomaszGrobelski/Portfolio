# Portfolio - README

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is a one-page application that highlights my skills, experience, and projects. The site is built using **React**, **SCSS**, and **TypeScript**. My goal is to provide a clear, user-friendly experience that showcases who I am as a developer and the work I've done.

## **Tech Stack**

This project was built using the following technologies:

### Frontend:
- **React** – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which I used to structure the entire portfolio.
- **SCSS** – A CSS preprocessor that I used to style the application, making it modular and easy to maintain.
- **TypeScript** – A typed superset of JavaScript, which helps with code scalability and improved developer experience by catching errors early in the development process.
